Single Player Mode
======================


This guide will walk you through running all the labs on your own.

You should probably skim through [the architecture outline](./01-architecture.md) first.

## 1. Prerequisites

* Create a vendor.replicated.com account
* Create and copy an API token, set it in your shell with `export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=...`
* Choose a unique name for your session, e.g. `dh-test`
* Install terraform
* Install a Go toolchain (this has been tested w/ 1.16)
* Install the `gcloud` CLI and log in with application default credentials: `gcloud auth application-default login`
* Add your `google_compute_engine` ssh key to the `ssh-agent` or configure `~/.ssh/config` correctly.
* You should probably skim through [the architecture outline](./01-architecture.md) first.

## 2. Create an environment JSON

Copy the example file and edit it with your name and slug.
Since single-player mode requires you to have server access to provision the boxes in the first place,
so you can omit the SSH public key if you'd like. 
You'll already have access to the vendor account, so email will be not be required either.

```
cp environments_test.json env-dh-test.json
vim env-dh-test.json
```

Whatever file you create, you should git-ignore it. 
I usually drop mine in a `.dex` folder which is globally git-ignored.

## 3. Choose your labs

You can use the `labs_all.json` file, or you can copy it to another file and edit it to remove labs you'd like to skip.
If you'd like to set up all the labs, you can skip the below commands and just pass `labs_json=labs_all.json` in step 4.

```
cp labs_all.json labs-dh-test.json
vim labs-dh-test.json
```

## 4. Provision your apps

The Makefile provides a handy wrapper around the golang code in `setup`. 
A simple invocation of the above two files might look like:

```shell
make apps \
  prefix=dh-test \
  labs_json=labs-dh-test.json \
  env_json=env-dh-test.json
```

The output of this will be a file at `terraform/provisioner_pairs.json`.
You can review this file to understand which GCP instances will be created.

You should log into your vendor.replicated.com account to briefly review the app, channels, releases, and customers that were created.

## 5. Terraform Init

* By default this procedure will deploy instances to the GCP Project `smart-proxy-839` in zone `us-central1-b`. To set an alternate project `export REPLICATED_GCP_PROJECT=...`. To set an alternate zone `export REPLICATED_GCP_ZONE=...`
* By default this procedure will provision a user account on the GCP instances that matches your currently logged in local user. To override this in cases where your GCP username differs from your workstation, set `export REPLICATED_GCP_USER=...`
* The terraform provisioners' connection settings leverage ssh-agent. If terraform errors with ssh timeouts, consider adding your local private key to ssh agent with `ssh-add -K ...`.

If you haven't already, initialize the terraform dir. You can cd in and run `terraform init`, or there's a `make` wrapper for this.

```shell
make -C terraform init
```

## 6. Terraform apply

There's a handy `make` wrapper for this.

```shell
make instances
```

## 7. Host file

Grab the host file from the `terraform/etchosts/` directory and follow the instructions in the comment to add host entries for the lab servers:

```text
$ cat terraform/etchosts/aj
# copy the below and add it to your hosts file with
#
#     echo '
#     <PASTE>
#     ' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

34.121.47.43	lab5-airgap-jump	# dppt-aj-lab5-airgap-jump
104.198.254.92	lab6-proxy-jump	# dppt-aj-lab6-proxy-jump
```

## 8. You're ready!

For each lab you provisioned, head to the README for that lab. 
For example, to walk through Lab 0, navigate to the [labs/lab0-hello-world README](../labs/lab0-hello-world).

## 9. Iterating

If you make changes to Lab YAMLs as part of a lab exercise, use the `make release` command for that lab.

If you are developing changes to a lab spec itself (e.g. changing how the instance is provisioned), you can re-run the
same `make apps` and `make instances` commands. `make apps` will recreate `provisioner_pairs.json`.

`make apps` and `make instances` can be used to add or remove environments/users. 

+ When an entry is added to the environments json, it will result in a new app creation (by running `make apps`) and the provisioner json output will be updated (which can be triggered via `make instances`).
+ When an entry is removed from the environments json, it will result in the corresponding app being removed in the vendor portal (by running `make apps`). The provsioner json will also be updated and after executing `make instances` the corresponding vm's will also be removed.
+ When an entry is added to the labs json, it will result in the corresponding channels and customers to be created (by running `make apps`) and the provisioner json output will be updated (which can be triggered via `make instances`).
+ When an entry is removed from the labs json, **NO UPDATES** will happen to the corresponding channels and customers for the apps defined in environment json! If you want to remove channels or customers, you'll have to remove them by removing the entry from environments.json and recreating them.

## 10. Cleaning up

+ Empty the `env_json` file by making it contain `[]`.
+ Run 
  ```shell
  make apps \
    prefix=dh-test \
    labs_json=labs-dh-test.json \
    env_json=env-dh-test.json
  make instances
  ```
