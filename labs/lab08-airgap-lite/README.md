    * Perform an upgrade of an application in an air gap environment
    * Use the `kubectl support-bundle` CLI in an air gap environment
* **Who this is for**:
    * Anyone who builds or maintains app manager applications (Full Stack / Devops/ Product Engineers)
* **Prerequisites**:
    * Basic working knowledge of Kubernetes
* **Outcomes**:
    * You can deliver an app manager application into an air gap environment
    * You can build confidence in performing upgrades and troubleshooting in air gap environments

## Overview

To practice performing an air gap installation from scratch, you will start this lab with a bare air gap server without an app manager installation. Then you will explore how some of the support techniques differ between online and air gap environments.

***
## Air gap workflow overview

1. Push a release and Replicated's air gap builder will prepare an air gap bundle.

   ![airgap-slide-1](img/airgap-slide-1.png)

1. Collect a license file, a download link, and a public Kubernetes installer bundle.

   ![airgap-slide-2](img/airgap-slide-2.png)

1. Move all three artifacts into the datacenter using a jump box.

   ![airgap-slide-3](img/airgap-slide-3.png)

   The previous diagram shows a three node cluster, but this lab uses only use a single node cluster.
   The app manager bundle will be moved onto the server using SCP, while the app bundle and license file will be uploaded using a browser UI through an SSH tunnel.

***
## Getting started


1. You will receive an invitation by email to log into https://vendor.replicated.com. Accept this invitation and set your password.

1. From the Settings page, copy the Application Slug. You will need this slug in a later step to set the `REPLICATED_APP`.

   ![kots-app-slug](img/application-slug.png)

***
## Instance overview

You will receive an email with the IP of a jump box and the name of an air gap server.

For example:

```text
dx411-dex-lab08-airgap-lite-jump = 104.155.131.205
dx411-dex-lab08-airgap-lite
```

In general, the name of the private server will be the same as the jump box, with the characters `-jump` removed from the suffix.

For example, you can construct both instance names programmatically as:

```shell
${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite-jump
```


```shell
${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite
```

### Connecting to the air gap server

1. Set your application slug, the public IP of your jump box, and your first name:
    ```shell
    export JUMP_BOX_IP=...
    export REPLICATED_APP=... # your app slug
    export FIRST_NAME=... # your first name (lower case)
    ```
    This will run in the foreground, and you won't see any output.
    
1. SSH into the air gap server using the following command:
    ```shell
    ssh -J ${FIRST_NAME}@${JUMP_BOX_IP} ${FIRST_NAME}@${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite
    ```
    > **Note**: The `-J` option allows you to connect to the target host by first making a SSH connection to the jump host (`${JUMP_BOX_IP}`) described by the destination, and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination (`${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite`).

    Optional: Instead of using the previous command to SSH into the air gap server, you can perform multiple steps to achieve the same result:
    ```shell
    local> ssh ${FIRST_NAME}@${JUMP_BOX_IP}
    jump> export REPLICATED_APP=...
    jump> ssh ${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite
    ```

1. When you are on the air gap server, run the following command to verify that the server does not have internet access: 

   ```shell
   curl -v https://kubernetes.io
   ```

1. When you've confirmed no internet access exists, you can ctrl+C the above command and proceed to the next section.

***
## Moving assets into place
To perform an air gap installation, you will need to collect the following assets:

* An air gap bundle containing the Kubernetes installer cluster components **
* An air gap bundle containing the application components **
* A license with the air gap entitlement enabled

> ** **Note**: These are separate artifacts to cut down on bundle size during upgrade scenarios where only the application version
is changing and no changes are needed to the underlying cluster.

If you haven't already, log out of the air gap instance with `exit` or ctrl+D.

#### Starting the Kubernetes installer bundle download

Perform an SSH into your jump box (the one with the public IP) `ssh <name>@<jump box IP address>`, and download the Kubernetes installer bundle.

##### Enabling air gap for a customer

Enable air gap for the `lab8` customer and click **Save Changes**:

![enable-airgap](./img/airgap-customer-enable.png)


##### Downloading air gap assets
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Download Portal** section.

   ![download-portal](img/airgap-customer-portal.png)

1. Click **Generate new password** and save the generated password in your notes.
1. Click the **View download portal** link to open the download portal.

    > **Note**: This is a link you would usually send to your customer, so from this point forward in the lab you will be wearing your "end user" hat.
1. From your jump box, run the following curl command. Replace the URL below with the one you get from the download portal.

    ```text
    <name>@{REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite-jump ~$ curl -o kurlbundle.tar.gz <URL>
    ```

   ![download-portal](img/download-portal-kurl.png)

   This will take several minutes to complete. You can leave this running and proceed to the next step. You will come back to this process in a few minutes.

#### Building an air gap release

By default, only the **Stable** and **Beta** channels will automatically build air gap bundles. For other channels, you have two options to create an air gap release:

- Manually build from the **Release history** view for a channel
- Set a channel to auto build all promoted releases

> **Note**: For a production application, air gap releases will be built automatically on the **Stable** channel.

For this lab, since you are working off the `lab08-airgap-lite` channel, you will want to enable air gap builds on that channel.

1. (Optional) You can check the build status by navigating to the **Release history** for the channel.

   ![release-history](img/channel-release-history.png)

1. You can build individual bundles on the **Release history** page, but you will likely want to edit the channel and enable the option for all releases. Next to **Automatically create airgap builds for all releases in this channel**, slide the toggle swith to `on` to enable this option.

   ![edit-channel](img/channel-edit-info-btn.png)

   ![auto-build](img/channel-enable-airgap.png)

   You should see all the bundles building or built on the **Release history** page:

   ![airgap-built](img/airgap-builds.png)

#### Continue downloading air gap assets
To continue downloading the air gap assets, navigate back to the download portal where you previously got the Kubernetes installer bundle URL.


1. Navigate to the **Embedded cluster** option and review the three downloadable assets.

   ![download-portal-view](img/download-portal-view.png)

1. Download the license file, but **do not** download the Kubernetes installer (kURL) bundle. This download was already started on the server in a previous step.

1. Download the `Latest Lab 1.8: Airgap Bundle` to your workstation.

1. SSH to your jump box (the one with the public IP) `ssh <name>@<jump box IP address>` and check the download of the Kubernetes installer (kURL) bundle.

1. At the beginning of the lab, we downloaded the bundle with this command from the jump box:

   ```text
   <name>@{REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite-jump ~$ curl -o kurlbundle.tar.gz <URL>
   ```

   When it is finished, copy it from the jump box to the air gap server. You can use the DNS name in this lab, as described in the [Instance Overview](#instance-overview).

   ```text
   <name>@{REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite-jump ~$ scp kurlbundle.tar.gz ${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite:~

   ```

   > **Note**: This lab uses SCP using an SSH tunnel, but the air gap methods in this lab also extend to more locked down environments where, for example, physical media is required to move assets into the datacenter.

1. SSH all the way to air gap node. If you still have a shell on your jump box, you can use the instance name:

   ```text
   <name>@{REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite-jump ~$ ssh ${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the one below:

   ```shell
   ssh -J ${FIRST_NAME}@${JUMP_BOX_IP} ${FIRST_NAME}@${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite
   ```

1. From the air gap node, untar the bundle and run the install script with the `airgap` flag. The Kubernetes installer (kURL) install flags are documented [in the kurl.sh docs](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/advanced-options).

   ```shell
   tar xvf kurlbundle.tar.gz
   sudo bash install.sh airgap
   ```

   At the end, you should see an `Installation Complete` message. 

Because this instance is in air gap mode, you must create a port forward to access the UI from your workstation in the next step.

```text
configmap/kurl-config created


		Installation
		  Complete âœ”


Kotsadm: http://10.128.1.47:30880
Login with password (will not be shown again): iunIEfPyc
This password has been set for you by default. It is recommended that you change this password; this can be done with the following command: kubectl kots reset-password default
```

***
## Accessing the UI using SSH and configuring the instance

You must create a port forward from your workstation in order to access the UI locally. In this lab, we will use the `REPLICATED_APP` to construct the DNS name, but you can input it manually as well. Run the following commands. These will run in the foreground, and you won't see any output.

```shell
export FIRST_NAME=... # your firstname (lowercase)
export JUMP_BOX_IP=... # your jumpbox IP
export REPLICATED_APP=... # your app slug
ssh -NL 30880:${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite:30880 -L 30888:${REPLICATED_APP}-lab08-airgap-lite:30888 ${FIRST_NAME}@${JUMP_BOX_IP}
```

At this point, Kubernetes and the admin console are running inside the air gapped server, but the application is not deployed yet.

To complete the installation:
1. Visit http://localhost:30880 in your browser.

1. Click **Continue to Setup** in the browser to navigate to the secure admin console.

   ![kots-tls-wanring](img/kots-tls-warning.png)

1. Click **Skip & continue** to accept the unsecure certificate in the admin console.
    > **Note**: For production installations we recommend uploading a trusted certificate and key, but for this tutorial we will proceed with the self-signed certificate.

   ![Console TLS](img/admin-console-tls.png)

1. On the login screen, paste the password noted previously on the `Installation Complete` screen. The password is shown in the output from the installation script.

   ![Log In](img/admin-console-login.png)

    Until this point, this server is just running Kubernetes and the `kotsadm` containers.
    The next step is to upload a license file so app manager can validate which application is authorized to be deployed. You must use the license file we downloaded earlier.

1. Click **Upload** and select your `.yaml` file to continue. You can also drag and drop the license file from a file browser. After you upload your license, you will be greeted with an Airgap Upload screen.

   ![Upload License](img/upload-license.png)

1. Select **choose a bundle to upload** and use the application bundle that you
downloaded to your workstation using the customer portal. Click **Upload Air Gap bundle** to continue the upload process.

   ![airgap-upload](img/airgap-upload.png)

You will see the bundle uploaded and images being pushed to kURL's internal registry. This will take a few minutes to complete.

![airgap-push](img/airgap-push.png)

When the bundle is uploaded, `Preflight Checks` will run. These are designed to ensure the server has the minimum system and software requirements to run the application.
Depending on your YAML in the `preflight.yaml` file, you can see some of the example preflight checks fail.
If you have failing checks, you can click **Continue** and the UI will show a warning that will need to be dismissed before you can continue.

![Preflight Checks](img/airgap-preflight.png)


You will see that the application is unavailable.

![app-down](img/app-down.png)

You will explore [support techniques for airgapped environments](#collecting-a-cli-support-bundle)
below, to observe that the deployment is simply not valid. Specifically, the
standard `nginx` entry point has been overridden:

```yaml
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          command:
            - exit
            - "1"
```

You must deploy a new release in order to fix this error.

***
## Deploying a new version

As part of the lab setup, a new release was created in the vendor portal with the fix. To make the release available:
1. Navigate to **Sequence 2** under **All releases**.  
1. Click **Promote**.
1. Select the `lab08-airgap-lite` channel as the channel to promote the release to.

   ![app-down](img/promote-sequence-2.png)

1. (Optional) If you are interested, you can review the differences between the two releases in the vendor portal. It is also shown below:

   ```diff
   diff --git a/labs/lab05-airgap/manifests/nginx-deployment.yaml b/labs/lab05-airgap/manifests/nginx-deployment.yaml
   index fa29e8d..3a66405 100644
   --- a/labs/lab05-airgap/manifests/nginx-deployment.yaml
   +++ b/labs/lab05-airgap/manifests/nginx-deployment.yaml
   @@ -16,9 +16,6 @@ spec:

                - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
                  name: html
   ```

1. When the promotion is done, navigate back to the customer download portal we accessed from the customer page.
    Scroll to the bottom and click **Show older bundles** to see the history of the releases on the `lab08-airgap` channel.

   The new release can take a minute or two to build. Refresh the page until you see a release with a timestamp that matches when you promoted your release.

   ![download-portal-more](img/download-portal-more.png)

1. When you've downloaded the new version, you can now deploy it:
   1. In the app manager admin console, select **Version History**. Click **Upload a new version**, and select your bundle.

      ![airgap-new-upload](img/airgap-new-upload.png)

      You see the bundle uploaded and you have the option to deploy it after the preflight checks are complete.
   1. Click **Deploy** to perform the upgrade.

   1. Click **Application** to navigate back to the main landing page. The app should now show the **Ready** status on the main dashboard.

   1. To access the application select **Open Lab 8**.
      > **Note**: The SSH tunnel for the application's port (30888) must be initialized for this to work successfully.

Congratulations! You have installed and then upgraded an air gap instance!

***
## Collecting a CLI support bundle

Let's review how to collect support bundles. What would you do in the event that the app installation itself was failing?

You can try our `kots.io` support bundle from the air gap server.

```shell
kubectl support-bundle https://kots.io
```

As expected, this will fail because we cannot fetch the spec from the internet.

```text
Error: failed to load collector spec: failed to get spec from URL: execute request: Get "https://kots.io": dial tcp 104.21.18.220:443: i/o timeout
```

In this case, pull in the spec from https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/blob/master/pkg/supportbundle/defaultspec/spec.yaml.

How you get this file onto the server is up to you. Expand the **Details** below for an option that uses `cat` with a heredoc.

When this is present, you can use the following to collect a bundle as usual:

```shell
kubectl support-bundle ./support-bundle.yaml
```

You can review an in depth post with some other options at [How can i generate a support bundle if i cannot access the admin console?](https://help.replicated.com/community/t/kots-how-can-i-generate-a-support-bundle-if-i-cannot-access-the-admin-console/455).

Congratultions! You have completed Exercise 8! [Back To Exercise List](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs)


***
## Extra exercises

If you finish the lab early, you can:

1. Experiment with copying the CLI-generated bundle off the server and uploading it to https://vendor.replicated.com.
1. Experiment with expanding or building your own `support-bundle.yaml` and using it to collect other information about the host.
