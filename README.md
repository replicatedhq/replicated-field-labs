KOTS Field Labs
========================

Resources for running a hands-on field training with KOTS and the KOTS troubleshooting toolset.

**Why do we offer it?** Provides your team the quickest way to learn our technology. If your team decides it is not the right tech, it saves your team time that would otherwise be spent in a time consuming POC.

**How do we do this?** We provision everything for your team, giving each participant their own environment to learn. We can schedule office hours/ onsite workshops to ensure we are there to answer any questions.

Please let us know when you would like to schedule this!

For more info, check out the [documentation](./doc).


### Curricula

A set of different curricula and tracks based on the current set of working labs. Will evolve over time.


#### Replicated Intro for Developers and Field Teams

If you're technical and getting hands on with Replicated, do these labs in order. More will be added here.
Good for developers packaging an app as well as Support/Success/Solutions Engineers working with Replicated in customer environments.

1. [Lab 0 - Hello World](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab00-hello-world)
2. [Lab 1 - Using Analyzers](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab01-ui-analyzers)
3. [Lab 2 - Support Bundle Basics and Authorizing Analyzers](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab02-adding-analyzers)
4. [Lab 3 - Troubleshooting from the CLI](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab03-support-cli)
3. [Lab 7 - Troubleshoot.sh Redactors](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab07-redactors)

#### Intermediate Replicated Topics

Labs from this track can be done in any order, they all have Lab 0 as a prerequisite.
Any can be omitted based on interest and needs.

1. [Lab 5 - Airgap](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab05-airgap)
2. [Lab 6 - Proxy](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab06-proxy)

4. [Lab 11 - Monitoring](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab11-monitoring)


#### A Focused Walkthrough of Airgap 

A very targeted walkthrough for folks who want to learn how to run an airgap install process in the field without doing the developer setup in Lab 0.
If you will be working with Airgap installs a lot, you should prefer Lab 5 from the [intermediate track](#intermediate-replicated-topics).

1. [Lab 8 - Airgap Lite](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab08-airgap-lite)

#### A Gentle introduction to Replicated for less technical folks

Walk through Replicated basics without needing to know SSH, CLIs or Git

1. [Lab 10 - Demo](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots-field-labs/tree/main/labs/lab10-demo)
