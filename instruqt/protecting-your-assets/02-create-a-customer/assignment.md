Creating a Customer License
===========================

Let's connect to the Replicated Vendor Portal and create a new customer and
their license. Click on the "Open External Window" button to open a new browser
window and access the portal. Log in with these credentials:

Username: `[[ Instruqt-Var key="USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]`<br/>
Password: `[[ Instruqt-Var key="PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]`

You'll land on the "Channels" page showing the default release channels.
