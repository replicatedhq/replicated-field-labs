üëã Introduction
===============

* **What you will do**:
    * Learn to use the `kots download` & `kots upload` command to rapidly iterate on a deployed instance
    * Learn how to take the modified manifests and then create a release
* **Who this is for**: This track is for anyone who will build KOTS applications **plus** anyone who will be user-facing
    * Full Stack / DevOps / Product Engineers
    * Support Engineers
    * Implementation / Field Engineers
    * Success / Sales Engineers
* **Prerequisites**:
    * Basic working knowledge of Linux (Bash)
    * This is an advanced topic so make sure you have completed the following tracks or have relevant hands=on experience
      * Deploy Hello World Application
      * Replicated CLI
* **Outcomes**:
    * You will be ready to rapidly develop on the Replicated platform!


üêö Get started
===============

In this track we are going to use several tabs so let's review how we will use each one:

* **Dev**: This tab provides access to our dev environment. Here we already installed the `Replicated` and `KOTS` command lines for your convenience.
* **K3S-VM**: This tab contains access to the VM hosting our K3s cluster, which we will use as our dev cluster.
* **Vendor**: This tab launches a browser to https://vendor.replicated.com which is the Vendor Portal. We will use this to get our Application Slug, API token and license file.
* **Admin Console**: This tab is not visible in this challenge but will be later in this track. The Admin Console will be used to install our sample application that we will iterate on.
* **Code Editor**: This tab is not visible in this challenge but will be later in this track. The Code Editor will be used to create a new deployment manifest later in the track.

## Checking your Environment

Let's make sure we have our environment ready to go before we get started.

Let's start with the **Dev** tab. Not only does it already have our command line tools installed, it also has `kubectl` access to our K3 cluster.
Select the **Dev** tab and try the following commands to ensure we have everything set up correctly:

```bash
replicated version
```

The above should return the version of the `replicated` command line. Anything else points to an issue with the dev environment. Next, let's see if we have access to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

The above should return a single node, which we can access over on the **K3S-VM** tab. Before we go there, let's make sure we also have the `kots` command line as well:

```bash
kubectl kots version
```

The above should return the version of the `kots` cli.

Let's head over now to the **K3S-VM** tab, where you should see the username and password we will use to login to the Vendor Portal. The username and password are based on your Participant ID, which is generated when you start a track.

We won't use this tab much in this track, but will be available in case we want to troubleshoot any issues with the cluster or application or need to retrieve the Vendor Portal credentials.

Let's now head over to the **Vendor** tab and make sure you can log in using the credentials provided in the **K3S-VM** tab. If you see the **Channels**, congratulations! you are in.

**Tip:** Stay logged in to Vendor Portal as you we will be using it on the next challenge.
