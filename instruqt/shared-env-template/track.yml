title: Shared Challenge Environment Template
teaser: |-
  A template track for sharing the shell environment across
  challenges
description: |-
  This track is a template track to build any lab that requires
  maintaining the shell and it's environment between challenges.

  To use it, run:

  ```
  instruqt track create --title [NEW TRACK TITLE] \
    --from shared-env-template
  ```

  The track provides both a shell and a single-node cluster, and
  the learner runs their commands as the user `replicant`.

  Another advantage of this template is that you can check what
  the learner has typed into their shell by capturing the `tmux`
  pane content and running a grep against it, see the sample
  check script in the first challenge for an example.
