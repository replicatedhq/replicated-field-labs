ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
===============

This exercise is designed to give you a sandbox to ensure you have a basic understanding how to work with the Replicated CLI.

* **What you will do**:
  * Use the Replicated CLI to validate and release your application
  * Find your installation command and install to an existing cluster
  * Iterate on your work and deploy an updated release
* **Who this is for**: This lab is for anyone who works with app code, docker images, k8s yamls, or does field support for multi-prem applications
  * Full Stack / DevOps / Product Engineers
  * Support Engineers
  * Implementation / Field Engineers
* **Prerequisites**:
  * Basic working knowledge of Kubernetes
* **Outcomes**:
  * You will build a working understanding of how to release and deploy a kubernetes application packaged with Replicated using kots.


ðŸš€ Let's start
==============

### 1. Vendor Portal login

To access the Vendor Portal, you can use the following credentials that were created as part of lab setup.

Username: `[[ Instruqt-Var key="USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]`<br/>
Password: `[[ Instruqt-Var key="PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]`

Once you have the credentials, you can log into the Vendor tab and you should land on the Release Channels page. Channels allow you to manage who has access to which releases of your application.


### 2. Configure environment

Once registered, your application will be automatically selected:

<p><img width="600" alt="Application Selected" src="../assets/application-selected.png"></p>

Now, you'll need to set up environment variables to interact with vendor.replicated.com and instance.

`REPLICATED_APP` should be set to the app slug from the Settings page.

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/cli-setup-quickstart-settings.png" width=600 alt="Finding your application slug"></img></p>

Next, you will need to create a `read/write` User API token from your [Account Settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings) page:
> Note: Ensure the token has "Write" access or you'll be unable create new releases.

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/create-api-token.png" width="1368" alt="Create and API token"></img></p>

Once you have the values, set them in your environment (the API token you created will not match the one below, but either will work).

```
export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=[[ Instruqt-Var key="REPLICATED_API_TOKEN" hostname="shell" ]]
export REPLICATED_APP=[[ Instruqt-Var key="REPLICATED_APP" hostname="shell" ]]
```

You can ensure this is working with

```
replicated release ls
```
