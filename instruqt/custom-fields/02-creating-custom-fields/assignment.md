### Vendor Portal login

In this lab, we'll use your partipant ID for your credentials in the Vendor Portal. The credentials are included in the **Shell** tab and are displayed in the following format:

```
username: [PARTICIPANT_ID]@replicated-labs.com
password: [PARTICIPANT_ID]
```

To access the Vendor Portal, click on the **Vendor** tab and login to the Vendor Portal. Once you log in, you should land on the Channels, which allow you to manage who has access to which releases of your application.

### Create Custom Field

Let's create the [Custom License Field](https://docs.replicated.com/vendor/licenses-adding-custom-fields) that we will use as a switch for our Super Duper Feature:

Navite to **License Fields** on the left hand side navigator.

Click on **Create custom field** and use the following values:

* **Field:** enable-feature
* **Title:** Enable Feature
* **Type:** Boolean
* **Default:** false

Leave the **Required** and **Hidden** boxes unchecked. Below is a screenshot of what it should look like:

Click on the **Create** button to create the field. Stay logged in to the Vendor Portal as we will need it in the next challege.

Congratulations! You have completed this challenge.
