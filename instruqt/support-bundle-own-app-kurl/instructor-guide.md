# Instructor Guide: Bring-Your-Own-App hands-on lab
https://play.instruqt.com/replicated/tracks/support-bundle-own-app-kurl

## Introduction

This hands-on lab is designed to be delivered by an instructor.  It can be run self-paced, but it benefits greatly from the presence of a guide to discuss and answer questions. The lab is expected to be delivered remotely, with the students sharing their workstation screen with the instructor.

## Instructor's Prerequisites

- A class of not more than 6-8 people.  More than this starts to hinder the discussion-based nature of the lab
- An Instruqt platform invitation link
- A calendar invite with a Zoom link for the session and the Instruqt invitation link
- This guide available in a tab


## Setup




### Scheduling the session

Coordinate with the Account Executive who handles the customer account to schedule the session.  Account for approximately 3-4 hours for the session, including time for introductions, breaks, and discussion.

### 1-2 weeks before the session

In the time before the session, the instructor needs to make sure that an Instruqt invitation link has been configured and a Google Calendar invite goes out to the attendees.

#### Making an Instruqt invitation link
