üöÄ Let's start
=================

Time for a new challenge! Now, a customer has reported that Rook-Ceph is unhealthy. Let's see if we can figure out what's going on.

üí° Hints
=================

- Ceph status is available from `ceph status` inside the rook-ceph-tools pod
  - `kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it rook-ceph-tools-xxxxx-yyyyyy -- ceph status`

‚úîÔ∏è Solution
=================

One of the Ceph monitor (`mon`) deployments has a PriorityClass that is not available on the cluster. This causes the deployment to be stuck in a `Pending` state.

Remediation
=================

Edit the `rook-ceph-mon` deployment and edit the `priorityClassName` field to `system-cluster-critical`.
