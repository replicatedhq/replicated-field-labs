üëã Install Hello World
===============

## Step 01

Go to the Application Installer tab, and login using the password you used in the previous step.

If you forgot the password, enter the shell and run `kubectl kots reset-password -n <yournamespace>`

## Step 02

Upload the license for the `Hola Customer` you downloaded in Challenge #2

## Step 03

Customize the hello world application by adding some text examples like below:

![Configuration](../assets/config.png)

For now, you can just ignore the `API token` and `Readonly text` fields.

## Step 04

Click `Continue` and watch the Preflights run. These preflights will validate the application environment.

Once the preflights are finished, you can check the results which will look like below

For now we will ignore the warnings and click `Continue`. As there is an issue with one of the preflights, you will have to confirm that you want to `Deploy and continue`.

## Step 05

Once you clicked on `Continue`, the Application Installer will deploy the Hello World Application.

If you want to check the "Hello World" application, you can do so by clicking on `Open App`

It will open a new tab and you should see something similar like the screenshot below:

If you've viewed the Hello World app, congratulations! You've deployed your first application using the Replicated Application Installer. You can click **Check** to finish this track.
