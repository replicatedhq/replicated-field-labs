üëã Introduction
===============

Use the terminal and `kubectl` to understand why you sometimes can't access nginx.
Use the `check-nginx.sh` script to verify if nginx is running.

<details>
  <summary>The script</summary>

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Checking nginx"
for i in {1..10}
do
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Response: %{http_code} %{errormsg}" localhost:30001
echo ""
sleep 2
done
```
</details>

üèÅ Solution
===========

Use the terminal and `kubectl` to fix the issue.

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>

Someone created a second deployment instead of changing the number of replicas. Use `k scale`? Or edit the deployment?
Also this is a great opportunity to talk about `readinessProbes` and `livenessProbes`.
