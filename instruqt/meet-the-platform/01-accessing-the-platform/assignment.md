The Replicated Platform is a unified platform bringing together everything you
need to navigate your Commercial Software Distribution Lifecycle. You use the
platform to efficiently manage, test, install, support, and measure the
distribution of your app. The Replicated Vendor Portal provides the interfaces
you need to work with the Platform from the web, the command-line, and
anywhere you can invoke its APIs.

This lab will introduce you to the Replicated Platform through the Vendor
Portal. After getting to know the Vendor Portal, you'll take the role of a
customer and install [SlackerNews](https://slackernews.io), an application
distributed with Replicated. From there, we'll show you how you'll work with
customers having a support issue, and how they'll install a fix.

Connecting to the Vendor Portal
===============================

Select the "Vendor Portal" tab and log in with the following credentials:

Username: `[[ Instruqt-Var key="USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]`<br/>
Password: `[[ Instruqt-Var key="PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]`

You'll land on the "Channels" page that shows the default release channels for
the Platform. Release channels connect releases of your software to the
customers who can install them. There are three default channels, though you
can create as many as you need. The [Distributing Your Application with
Replicated](https://play.instruqt.com/replicated/tracks/distributing-with-replicated)
lab for more details.
