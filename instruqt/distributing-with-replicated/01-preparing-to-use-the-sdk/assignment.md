ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
===============

The Replicated SDK is implemented as a small service that runs
alongside your application and enables access to the Replicated
Platform. The SDK allows you to enforce your entitlements and
take advantage of the telemetry that Replicated provides to help
you better understand customer instances. It also allows you
to get information about your application and its releases,
including checking for updates and showing version history.


âœ… Preparing to use the SDK
===========================

To make use of the Replicated SDK, you'll need a couple of
things. They've been set up for you in this lab environment.

1. A Helm chart for your application. We're going to use the
   Open Source Bitnami Helm chart for the Harbor container registry
   for this lab, but it could be the Helm chart for your product
   or any other Helm chart you wanted to distribute this way.
2. Access to the Replicated Vendor Portal. You've been given
   access for the duration of this lab with the username
   `[[ Instruqt-Var key="USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]` and
   the password `[[ Instruqt-Var key="PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]`
3. An application on the Replicated Vendor Portal. It was also
   created for you as part of the lab setup.
4. A customer for that application. The automation created the
   customer as well.

ðŸ”¤ Getting Started
==================

To use the SDK, we need to add a dependency to the Harbor
Helm chart. Let's pull down the chart so that we can get
started.

```bash
helm pull --version 19.1.0 oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/harbor --untar
```

Let's also set up our shell for interacting with the Replicated
platform.

```
export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN="[[ Instruqt-Var key="REPLICATED_API_TOKEN" hostname="shell" ]]"
```

And lastly make sure we are working with the Harbor app that was
created by the lab setup.

```
export REPLICATED_APP="[[ Instruqt-Var key="REPLICATED_APP" hostname="shell" ]]"
```
