ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
===============

The Replicated SDK is implemented as a small service that runs
alongside your application and enables access to the Replicated
Platform. The SDK allows you to enforce your entitlements and
take advantage of the telemetry that Replicated provides to help
you better understand customer instances.

âœ… Preparing to use the SDK
===========================

To make use of the Replicated SDK, you'll need a couple of
things. In the lab environment. They've been set up for you
in this lab environment.

1. A Helm chart for your application. We're going to use the
   Open Source Bitnami Helm chat for the Mastadoon social network.
2. Access to the Replicated Vendor Portal. You've been given
   access for the duration of this lab with the username
   `[[ Instruqt-Var key="USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]` and
   the password `[[ Instruqt-Var key="PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]`
3. An application on the Replicated Vendor Portal. We've also
   created that for you as part of the lab setup.
4. A customer for that application. We've created the customer as
   well.

ðŸ”¤ Getting Started
==================

To use the SDK, we need to add a dependency to the Mastodon
Helm chart. Let's pull down the chart so that we can get
started.

```bash
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/mastodon --untar
```

Let's also set up our shell for interacting with the Replicated
platform.

```
export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN="[[ Instruqt-Var key="REPLICATED_API_TOKEN" hostname="shell" ]]"
```

And lastly make sure we are working with the Mastadon app

```
export REPLICATED_APP="[[ Instruqt-Var key="REPLICATED_APP" hostname="shell" ]]"
```
