Let’s start with how to create an environment using the Compatibility Matrix. In this exercise we will examine the different matrix commands and their uses as well as build and tear down a few environments for practice.
========================

1. Look at the new cli commands and run a few to see what’s up

``` replicated cluster ```

2. Get list of supported images (wc)

``` replicated cluster something ```

3. Create a cluster from scratch. Connect to it, then delete it.
4. Create another cluster with a very short (2 minute) duration. Verify it exists
5. Create 3-node cluster with multiple OS.  (Keep this)
6. Install application in all three nodes.
7. Verify that the cluster from step 4 is gone, as the TTL has expired
