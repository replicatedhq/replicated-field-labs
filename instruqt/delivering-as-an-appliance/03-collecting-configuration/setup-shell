      title: Application Core
      description: |
        For this section, you can specify some core parameters for how
        Slackernews operates, including the domain where users will access it
        and the user who can administer it.

        Users that you specify under **Admin Users** will be able to access the
        Slackernews adminstrative console at `/admin`, allowing them to manage
        content, users, and settings. Changes will take effect the next time
        they are active in the Slackernews application.
      items:
        - name: slackernews_domain
          title: Ingress Hostname
          help_text: >
            The domain name at which you'll access SlackerNews. Don't include
            the `https://` or any path elements.

            want to grant admin access to.

    - name: ingress
      title: Application Access
      description: |
        You can customize how you will expose SlackerNews to the internet.
        Note that the domain you use will need to be publicly addressable with certs signed by a public authority
        so it can receive webhooks from Slack.

        Common configurations include:

        - **ClusterIP** Using a Cluster IP and configuring your existing ingress controller to route traffic to SlackerNews
        - **NodePort** Using a NodePort and configuring an existing load balancer to route traffic to SlackerNews
        - **LoadBalancer** Using a LoadBalancer service and letting Kubernetes provision a load balancer for you

        If you're running in a supported cloud provider and want Kubernetes to provision a Load Balancer, use LoadBalancer.

      description: |
        If desired, you can preconfigure the slack settings for SlackerNews.
        These are required for logging into SlackerNews and pulling/organizing content from your slack instance.
        If you don't preconfigure these settings, you'll be prompted to configure them when you first access SlackerNews.

        Instructions on how to configure your slack application and collect these values can be found in [the SlackerNews slack documentation](https://docs.slackernews.io/slack/).
