title: Delivering Your Application as a Kubernetes Appliance
teaser: |-
  Package your application as a Kubernetes appliance to simplify
  installation and operation.
description: |-
  The Replicated Embeded Cluster lets you distribute your application
  without a dependency on the customer's Kubernetes environment.
  Customers install the application like any other Linux services
  then follow a guided process to complete the application. The
  cluster and application are tightly coupled and share an
  adminstration console to simplify Day Two operations.

  This lab explores the Replicated Embedded Cluster and the
  appliance-like experience it provides for you customers. You'll
  learn how to:

    * Configure the details of the Kubernetes cluster
    * Customize the install and Admin Console experience for you
      application
    * Simplify configuration with a form to collect essential
      values
    * Specify which customer can use the Embedded Cluster
    * Install the appliance to understand your customer's experience
    * Expand the installed cluster
