üêö Correcting
===============

In order to correct this issue you'll need to add the missing file.

<details>
  <summary>Expand for shell commands</summary>

```
sudo touch /etc/support/config.txt
sudo chmod 400 /etc/support/config.txt
```
</details>

üèÜ  Validating
===============

If we run another support bundle, we should now see this check passes. Go to the Application Installer tab and generate another support bundle.

Once the fix is done, we can wait for the nginx pod to recover from CrashLoopBackoff, or we can give the pod a nudge to get it to retry immediately:

```text
kubectl delete pod -l app=nginx -n support
```

Furthermore, we should now see that the application shows ready in the admin console, and we can open it via the link (`Open Nginx`):

Congrats! You've completed the Support Bundle Track!
