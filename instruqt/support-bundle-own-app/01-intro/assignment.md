ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
===============

* **What you will do**:
  * Learn to troubleshoot application & cluster problems using Support Bundles and `sbctl`
* **Who this is for**: This track is for anyone who will build KOTS applications **plus** anyone who will be user-facing
  * Full Stack / DevOps / Product Engineers
  * Support Engineers
  * Implementation / Field Engineers
  * Success / Sales Engineers
* **Prerequisites**:
  * Basic working knowledge of Linux (Bash)
  * A release of your application is available in Replicated Vendor Portal
  * A trial or dev license for your application so you can install it for yourself
* **Outcomes**:
  * You will be able to determine if the problem is in your application, in Kubernetes, or in the infrastructure environment
  * You will be ready to use KOTS's support bundle feature to diagnose first-line issues in end-user environments
  * You will reduce escalations and expedite time to remediate for such issues

The environment is already configured for an "existing cluster" installation.  Check that the Kubernetes environment is running and that `kubectl` is configured correctly by running `kubectl get nodes` in the terminal.

Press **Next** when you're ready to begin.
