üöÄ Let's start
=================

You get another report from a customer saying that the application isn't working, as if two components are unable to communicate.  How would you begin to solve the problem?

üí° Hints
=================

- Think about the traffic flow to your application
- How does traffic get to workloads inside kubernetes

‚úîÔ∏è Solution
=================

A random service has been selected and the port number changed to a random port number.

Remediation
=================

Patch or edit the affected service to correct the port number. you may have to refer to the other resources in the cluster to identify the correct port number.
