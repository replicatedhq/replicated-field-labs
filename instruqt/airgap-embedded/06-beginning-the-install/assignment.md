In this lab we're using kURL to turn our air-gapped system into a single-node
Kuberenetes cluster. Our installation begins by connecting to the air-gapped
instance over SSH. From there we unpack the kURL bundle and run the included
install script. When these steps are complete we'll be able to install our
application into the cluster.

Let's Connect
=============

Since we're installing directly on the air-gapped node, let's connect to it.
We're using our jumpbox's SSH connection into the air-gap network.

```shell
ssh cluster
```

Once you're on the node, untar the bundle and run the install script
with the `airgap` flag. kURL install flags are documented
[in the kurl.sh docs](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/advanced-options).
Since there's only one tarball on the host, you can use a wildcard to expand
it.

```shell
tar xvf *.tar.gz
sudo bash install.sh airgap
```

At the end, you should see a `Installation Complete` message as shown below.
Since the instance is Air Gap, we'll need to use a port forward and proxy for
the UI in the next step. Note that the IP address and password you see will
differ from mine.

Kotsadm: http://10.128.1.47:30880
Login with password (will not be shown again): iunIEfPyc
This password has been set for you by default. It is recommended that you change this password; this can be done with the following command: kubectl kots reset-password default
```

Change Default Password
=======================

Let's follow the advice from the install command and change the default
password to something easy to remember. Run the following command and
pick a password that you'll use in the next step.

```
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
kubectl kots reset-password default
```

Disconnect
==========

Make sure you disconnect from the cluster node before moving on to the
next step. Press "control-D" to log out.
