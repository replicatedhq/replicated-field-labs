    ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
    ===============

    In this exercise you will learn how to perform installations in air gap environments, and
    how to collect support bundles in air gap environments.

    * **What you will do**:
        * Access and verify a single-node air gap setup via a bastion server
        * Learn to use KOTS to install in an air gap environment
        * Create an SSH tunnel to configure an air gap instance
        * Perform an upgrade of an application runnning in an air gap
        * Collect a support bundle in an air-gapped environment
    * **Who this is for**: This lab is for anyone who builds/maintains KOTS applications (see
        note below)
        * Full Stack / DevOps / Product Engineers
    * **Outcomes**:
        * You will be ready to deliver a KOTS application into an air gap environment
        * You will build confidence in performing upgrades and troubleshooting in
        air gap environments

    ============

    First, we'll push a release -- in the background, Replicated's air gap builder 
    will prepare an air gap bundle.

    Next, we'll collect a license file,
        a download link, and a public kURL bundle.

    From there, we'll move all three artifacts into the datacenter via a jump box.

    The above diagram shows a three node cluster, but we'll use only a single node.
    While the KOTS bundle will be moved onto the server via SCP as in the diagram,
    the app bundle and license file will be uploaded via a browser UI through an SSH tunnel.

ðŸš€ Let's start
==============

## Connecting to the Replicated Vendor Portal

Log into the Replicated Vendor Portal in the "Vendor Portal" tab using the username
and password printed to your screen in the "Shell" tab.

```
username: [PARTICIPANT_ID]@replicated-labs.com
password: [PARTICIPANT_ID]
```

Once you have the credentials, you can login into the Vendor tab and you should land on the Channels tab.

![Vendor Portal Login](../assets/vendor-portal-login.png)

After logging in, you're going to identify your application and create an API token to use with the
Replicated command-line, then set up some environment variables in your shell to store them.

### Configure environment

When you log in, you'll be on our release channels page.

![Release Channels on the Vendor Portal](../assets/release-channels.png)

Go from the channels page to the settings page to see the application slug. The slug is how the
Replicated CLI and API uniquely identify applications. We'll need to know the slug to use the
CLI later in the lab.

![Finding Your Application Slug](../assets/application-slug-in-settings.png)

When you go back to the "Shell" tab you'll set the variable `REPLICATED_APP` to the app slug. This tells
the `replicated` command which application you are working on without you having to passing it as
an argument to every command.

Next, create a `read/write` User API token from your [Account Settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings)
page:

![Creating an API token](../assets/create-api-token.png)

Note: Ensure the token has "Write" access or you'll be unable to create new releases.

Once you have the values, go back to the "Shell" tab and set them in your environment.

```
export REPLICATED_APP=...
export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=...
```

You can ensure this is working with

```
replicated release ls
```
