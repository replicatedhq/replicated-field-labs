ðŸš€ Let's start
==============


### Configure environment

Log into the Replicated Vendor Portal in the "Vendor Portal" tab using the username
and password printed to your screen in the "Shell" tab.

```
username: [PARTICIPANT_ID]@replicated-labs.com
password: [PARTICIPANT_ID]
```

Once you have the credentials, you can login into the Vendor tab and you should land on the Channels tab.

After logging in, you're going to identify your application and create an API token to use with the
Replicated command-line, then set up some environment variables in your shell to store them.

When you log in, you'll be on our release channels page.

Go from your

![Finding Your Application Slug](../assets/cli-setup-quickstart-settings.png)

When you go back to the "Shell" tab you'll set the variable `REPLICATED_APP` to the app slug from the Settings page.


Next, create a `read/write` User API token from your [Account Settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings)
page:

![Creating an API token](../assets/create-api-token.png)

Note: Ensure the token has "Write" access or you'll be unable create new releases.

Once you have the values, set them in your environment.

```
export REPLICATED_APP=...
export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=...
```

You can ensure this is working with

```
replicated release ls
```
