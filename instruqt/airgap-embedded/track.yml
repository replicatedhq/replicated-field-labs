title: Installing in an Air-Gapped Environment
teaser: Template track for a jumpbox connecting to an airgaped host
description: |-
  This track is a template track to build any lab that requires
  an airgaped host. To use it, run:

  ```
  instruqt track create --title [NEW TRACK TITLE] \
    --from airgap-template
  ```

  This template does not provide a Kubernetes cluster in the air-gapped
  network, so it is best used with embedded cluster installs.
