    * Full Stack / DevOps / Product Engineers
    * Support Engineers
    * Implementation / Field Engineers
    * Success / Sales Engineers
* **Prerequisites**:
  * Basic working knowledge of Linux and the `bash` shell
* **Outcomes**:

# Configure the VM environment

## Set up the Workstation

The environment is prepped for an *embedded cluster* installation.

### Configure your editor

Before we begin, let's choose an editor.  The default editor is `nano`, but if you'd like to use `vim` instead, you can switch to it by running the following command and selecting option `2`:

```bash
update-alternatives --config editor
```

Press **Check** when you're ready to begin.
