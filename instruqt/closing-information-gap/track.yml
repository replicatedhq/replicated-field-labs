  customers and your support team
description: |-
  Learn how to use the Replicated Platform and the [Troubleshoot](https://troubleshoot.sh)
  open source project to close the information gap between your customers and
  your supprot team.

   **This lab demonstrates how to:**

   * Review telemetry provided by customer instances to gain insight into their
     instance of your application
   * Define a support bundle that gives your team the information they need about
     a customer's running instance to resolve issue faster
   * Iterate on your support bundle definition to avoid having to solve the same
     issue multiple times
